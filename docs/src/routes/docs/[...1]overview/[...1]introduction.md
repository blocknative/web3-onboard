# Web3-Onboard

The best way to connect a wallet 🚀

<img src="{walletModal}" alt="Web3-Onboard connect wallet modal"/>

Web3-Onboard is the quickest and easiest way to add multi-wallet and multi-chain support to your project. With built-in modules for more than 35 unique hardware and software wallets, Web3-Onboard saves you time and headaches.

## Features

- **Minimal Dependencies**

All wallet dependencies are included in separate packages,
so you only include the ones you want to use in your app.

- **Multiple Wallets and Accounts Connection, Multichain Support**

Allow your users to connect multiple wallets and multiple accounts within each wallet at the same time to your app. Let users switch between chains/networks with ease.

- **Unified Provider Interface**

All wallet modules expose a provider that is patched to be compliant with the EIP-1193, EIP-1102, EIP-3085 and EIP-3326 specifications.
Whether your user is using Ledger or Metamask the provider will operate identically.

- **Dynamic Imports**

Supporting multiple wallets in your app requires a lot of dependencies. Onboard dynamically imports a wallet
and it's dependencies only when the user selects it, so that minimal bandwidth is used.

- **Framework Agnostic**

Avoid framework lock in -- Web3-Onboard works with any framework and includes helper packages for vue & react.

- **Account Center**

An interface to manage wallet connections and networks, with a minimal version for mobile

- **Notify**

Real-time transaction notifications for all transaction states for the connected wallet address(es). In-notification speedups & cancels for hardware wallet connections.

### Supported Networks

web3-onboard supports all EVM networks. Supporting a new network is simply a matter of adding its details in the Chains section upon initialization. For more information see [initialization options](https://github.com/blocknative/web3-onboard/blob/feature/documentation/docs/src/routes/docs/%5B...3%5Dpackages/core.md#initialization).
- Arbitrum
- Avalanche
- BNB Chain
- Celo
- Ethereum
- Fantom
- Gnosis Chain
- Harmony One
- Moonriver
- Optimism
- Polygon
- Any other EVM network

### [Optional] Use an API key to fetch real time transaction data, balances & gas
Using a Blocknative API key with web3-onboard on the free plan will allow you to gain the benefits of Blocknative balance & transaction services. Blocknative has a free forever plan you can always use.

This step is not required to use web3-onboard. You can skip to the **Quickstart** step below if you want to use web3-onboard without API services or if you already have a Blocknative account & API key.

**Setup your Account**
Go to the Account Dashboard at https://explorer.blocknative.com/account and setup an account with an email address. You will receive an email to confirm your account.

**Create your API Key**
On the Account Dashboard at https://explorer.blocknative.com/account, create an API key with your choice of name or use/rename the Default Key. Consider using different API keys for development, staging, and production releases.

## Quickstart

Install the core Onboard library, the injected wallets module and optionally ethers.js to support browser extension and mobile wallets:

<Tabs values={['npm', 'yarn']}>
<TabPanel value="yarn">

```sh copy
yarn add @web3-onboard/core @web3-onboard/injected-wallets ethers
```

  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel value="npm">

```sh copy
npm i @web3-onboard/core @web3-onboard/injected-wallets ethers
```

  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

You can find a link to web3-onboard's official NPM Documentation here: [@web3-onboard/core Official NPM Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-onboard/core)

Then initialize in your app:
```ts
import Onboard from '@web3-onboard/core'
import injectedModule from '@web3-onboard/injected-wallets'
import { ethers } from 'ethers'

const MAINNET_RPC_URL = 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<INFURA_KEY>'

const injected = injectedModule()

const onboard = Onboard({
  wallets: [injected],
  chains: [
    {
      id: '0x1',
      token: 'ETH',
      label: 'Ethereum Mainnet',
      rpcUrl: MAINNET_RPC_URL
    }
  ]
})

const wallets = await onboard.connectWallet()

console.log(wallets)

if (wallets[0]) {
  // create an ethers provider with the last connected wallet provider
  const ethersProvider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(
    wallets[0].provider,
    'any'
  )

  const signer = ethersProvider.getSigner()

  // send a transaction with the ethers provider
  const txn = await signer.sendTransaction({
    to: '0x',
    value: 100000000000000
  })

  const receipt = await txn.wait()
  console.log(receipt)
}
```
**and you are live!**

## Wallet Modules
Add other wallet modules such as Wallet Connect or Ledger to increase the support and functionality of your web3-onboard implementation. All modules are listed below and can be accessed through the subpages of web3-onboard docs on the left.

We recommend you add the [Core Repo](https://onboard.blocknative.com/docs/packages/core#install) and consider adding the [Injected Wallets](https://onboard.blocknative.com/docs/packages/injected#install) module to get connected with wallets like Metamask, Tally, Coinbase Wallet & more right away.
